I am currently taking USC's graduate course in Natural Language Processing, taken by Prof. Ron Artstein (ron.artstein.org/csci544-2016/index.html).

This repo contains the code that I have written and will be writing during the length of the course. 

I am super excited about this course and I believe that my research background in Information Retrieval is a solid foundation for this course.

I hope the code I write for this course will help some programmer around the world in his/her work.
